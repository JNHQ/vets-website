According to recent research:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Connecting with friends may also boost your brain health and lower your risk of dementia.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>People who regularly connect with others generally perform better on tests of memory and other cognitive skills.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>In the long run, people with active social lives are less likely to develop dementia than those who are more socially isolated.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>People with more social support also tend to live longer, and this is true even after accounting for overall health.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Social engagement is associated with a stronger immune system, especially for older adults. This means you are better able to fight off colds, the flu and even some types of cancer.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Interacting with others boosts feelings of well-being and decreases feelings of depression.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Ways to boost your social engagement:&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Sign up for activities at your local recreation center, library or event center.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Join a choir or musical group.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Volunteer at your favorite charity organization.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Visit a museum with a friend and chat about what you see.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Participate in a neighborhood or community group.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Play a group sport like lawn bowling, golf or croquet.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Have a friend or family member over for coffee or tea.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Play cards or board games with others.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Exercise with a friend by walking, swimming or going to the gym together.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Take a class to meet new friends.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>VA Pittsburgh's Recreation Services offers many opportunities for connecting with fellow Veterans and the community.
